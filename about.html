<p><strong>Hi! I’m Mari-Liis, a freelance photographer and social media manager. I’m originally from Tallinn, Estonia, and I moved to Orihuela Costa, Spain in 2023, seeking better weather and a break from the stressful corporate environment.</strong></p>
​<p>During my first two years here, I worked in hospitality as a waitress in a bar and a breakfast café. In the summer of 2025, I took on promotional work for a local candle and home fragrance brand at their commercial center, and I still occasionally help them in their flagship store or with production during busy periods. These experiences gave me valuable insight into local business practices and the needs of small businesses in the area.</p>
​<p>I specialize in food and product photography, but I also enjoy capturing portraits and candid moments. It was my last boss who suggested I focus on food photography, as there’s high demand for it locally and few photographers offering this service. I already had experience in product photography from a marketing role in Estonia.</p>
​<p>With an extensive background in corporate sales and marketing, I now help local business owners who lack the time or expertise to manage their social media accounts effectively. Combining photography and marketing experience allows me to showcase businesses in the best light and help them grow online.</p>
​<p>If you’d like to learn more about my education and professional experience, feel free to check out my LinkedIn profile below.</p>
